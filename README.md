BATCH IMAGE CONVERTOR V1.00 (released 2022)
ORIGINAL BY DJOR TECHNOLOGIES, FOR FYLE

This program is an easy-to-use image convertor that accepts jpg, png, gif and tiff files (both to import and export).

USAGE:
-Drag the files you wish to convert into the 'Input folder'
-Run the 'Batch Image Convertor V1.00.exe' program. 
-When prompted, enter the name of the format you wish to convert to. Some known-to-work extension types are included, but you may input any format.
NOTE: this program does not support all image formats. If the images do not convert, chances are that the file type you inputted is not supported.
-Press the 'Begin Conversion' button at the bottom of the screen. A popup should appear saying 'Conversion in Progress...'
-Once complete, the popup will say 'Conversion Complete, you may now close the program'. 
-At this point you may close the program, or put new files into the 'Input' folder and run another conversion

!IMPORTANT!
-The program can not yet detect errors if the Input folder is empty, or if the image type is unsupported. If conversion is taking a particularly long time, chances are the program has encountered one of these errors.
-Leaving files in the Output folder may result in them being overwritten if files with the same name are converted.
-The program only works from converting 2 or more files.
